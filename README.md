# Human-efficient labeling of a solar flux emergence video dataset by a deep learning model
Code from our article 'Human-efficient labeling of a solar flux emergence video dataset by a deep learning model' to create model-ensemble through training-validation combination and dropouts.

Evaluated uncertainty on test set using model-ensemble is shown below-
